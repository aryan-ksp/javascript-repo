// strings can be written as double quote and single quote both

const name = "aryan"
const repoCount = 50
console.log(name + repoCount);
console.log(name +  repoCount + "hahaha")
console.log(name + repoCount + " hahaha");

//another syntax to write 

console.log(' Hello, My name is ${name} and my RepoCount is ${repoCount}');
